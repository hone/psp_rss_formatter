  <itunes:summary><![CDATA[In today's lesson we return with another outburst of marital dischord, and a dialogue that falls somewhere around the upper boundary of our Elementary series. The mandarin here will come at you fast and furious as our voice actors tear into each other at full speed and sometimes even yell over each other - just like a real argument.

If you find yourself despairing of the speed, take a deep breath though. With the exception of a single idiom, our vocabulary is relatively basic.  And in addition to all the screaming and melodrama you can handle in a Monday podcast, this podcast covers a very useful way and relatively basic way to express the Future Tense. This is the powerful 会... 的 construct, which you'll be using all the time.

  <description><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://data.popupchinese.com/353/image.jpg"></p><p></p>Today we delve into the messy end of a typical Chinese break-up. Despite the fact that it sounds a lot like one of Echo's Korean soap operas, this podcast has been inspired by real-life events. We have stories involving Hong Kong art smugglers, knifed fruit and death threats. We're sure you've got stories too: when you come to Beijing look us up and we'll swap them over a beer or two.<p></p>All that said, we were a bit torn about how to classify today's lesson. The Chinese in this podcast is more difficult than in our typical Elementary lesson, but also easier than our average Intermediate. We finally settled on Elementary as the vocabulary covers family relationships, pets and children. This is relatively basic stuff, but don't worry if you find it a bit challenging given the emotions involved, and the fact that plates are probably being flung through the air during the dialogue.

If you have questions about the materials after that, you can visit the text section for our line-by-line translation and mouseover popups, or ask questions in the discussion section. If you find yourself missing some of the vocabulary, we've highlighted the most critical words in our vocab section.<p></p>Good luck!

Now you've finally pulled off your first major contract, holding firm with your Chinese partners when necessary, but never letting anyone lose face, and making sure the deal stayed win-win for everyone. You are a rising star.<p></p>Think you're a hot shot? Consider these negotiations training for a far greater challenge: life with Mimi.
